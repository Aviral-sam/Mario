# Mario
Creating a classic Mario game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is indeed a delightful project that not only brings back cherished memories but also sharpens one's web development skills. HTML provides the structure, CSS brings in the styling, and JavaScript adds the interactive elements, making it possible to recreate the adventures of the beloved plumber in a web browser. This project can serve as an excellent learning experience, offering a hands-on approach to understanding game mechanics, design principles, and programming logic. It's a creative way to combine fun with education, engaging both beginners and experienced developers in the art of game creation.  < 100 words
